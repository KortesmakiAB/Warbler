def profile()
Q. Why is it that "form = UserEditForm(obj=g.user)" (from forms.py) does not add the current password to the form?
Is this a security risk?
A. check answer key

What is user "location" for if we never use it?
    Should I allow it to be an option in "edit" profile()?

No link to '/users'

problems with "unfollow" on '/users/
    does def stop_following() work?

What is generator folder? How does it work?

Look over HTML to see how it's organized.

TESTS:
I did not write tests for "is_following" and "is_followed_by" from models.py because I'm not using those methods in this app.

Do we ever test relationships/foreign keys?


Differences between ValueError and exc.IntegrityError (test_user_model.py)
    User.signup: 
        Why is it that I could omit a non-nullable field (password) and get a ValueError,
        but also omit a non-nullable field (username), which is also unique, and get an IntegrityError?

    "def test_User_signup_invalid()":
        After experimenting, I learned that if there is only 1 IntegrityError thrown in my "with block", then the whole test passes. 
        Should I have written "def test_User_signup_invalid()" and "def test_Message_model_invalid_input()" (from test_message_model.py) as multiple/separate tests?
        Or is there a way to change my "with block" so all tests must pass?
        Or is it fine the way it is??
         
I did not test User model for non-nullable fields. Should I have written those tests?
