#### ROUTES (app.py)
def messages_add()
This should not sucessfully create an instance? 3 other fields have nullable = False.
    msg = Message(text=form.text.data)
    Why is this working?
    I tried dropping all tables and re-creathing and it did not help.


#### Models

Why is it that a user must delete all messages before they can delete their user account?
    I thought that if we used ondelete="cascade" behavior, then all messages/follows/likes, etc would also be deleted. 
    All likes and follows appear to delete themselves, but there appears to be an issue specific to cascade deleting messages.


#### Tests
test.user.model.py  -  def test_User_signup_invalid(self):
Why do I get 2 different errors for the same violation?
    A non-unique username gives a IntegrityError
    A non-unique email gives a InvalidRequestError
